        <p>
            You approach the door on the left,
    <br>    
            wincing when it creaks noisily as you open it
    <br>
            and find a dark room with a faint glow. 
    <br>
            You walk inside and see a ghost floating in the air. 
    <br>
            It looks at you and says "Boo!". 
    <br> 
            You laugh and say "That's it? That's your best scare?". 
    <br>
            The ghost sighs and says "Sorry, I'm new at this. Do you
    <br>
             have any tips?". You decide to help the ghost improve its 
    <br>
            haunting skills by giving it some advice.
    <br>
        
        <p>It isn't until your in bed, almost asleep, that you realise 
    <br>
            you never did find out who sent you that letter.</p>
