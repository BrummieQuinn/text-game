        <p>You Choose The Right Door</p>

    <main>

        <p> You approach the door on the right, 
    <br>
            when you open it and find a bright room with a giant web.
    <br>
            You walk inside and see a spider crawling on the ceiling. 
    <br>
            It looks at you and says "Hello!". You scream and say 
    <br>
            "What the hell? You can talk?". The spider nods and says "Yes, I can. 
    <br>
            And I'm very lonely. Do you want to be my friend?". You decide to try 
    <br>
            to escape the spider's web by making up some excuses.
    <br>        
        <p> Too late!  
    <br>        
            Your stuck, seeing your struggle, the spider smiles showing wicked sharp 
    <br>
            teeth.  It begins to rapidly make its way towards you.
    <br>
            Unable to reach your weapons, you nod to yourself, you close your eyes as you realise 
    <br>
            you'll never know who sent the letter now - END</p>
    <br>
        <p>END</p>
