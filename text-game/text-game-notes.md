### Choice 1 - Choose your character:

Who are you? 
A. Rogue or B. Necromancer?

  - If you choose Rogue, you can sneak around and use daggers and traps, but you have to rely on your skills and luck. You hope to find some treasure in the mansion, or at least some clues about the letter.

  - If you choose Necromancer, you can summon undead minions to fight for you, but you have to deal with the smell and the moral implications. You hope to find some secrets in the mansion, or at least some new allies.

  ### Choice 2:

- As you enter the mansion, you see a dusty hallway with two doors.

 - The left door has a sign that says "Beware of the ghost". You think it might be a trap, or maybe a challenge. You like challenges.

 - The right door has a sign that says "Beware of the spider". You think it might be a joke, or maybe a test. You like tests.

Each door has a sign that seems to warn you of something. Which one do you choose?

### Choice 3:

- left door:
- If you chose the left door, you open it and find a dark room with a faint glow. You walk inside and see a ghost floating in the air. It looks at you and says "Boo!". You laugh and say "That's it? That's your best scare?". The ghost sighs and says "Sorry, I'm new at this. Do you have any tips?". You decide to help the ghost improve its haunting skills by giving it some advice.
- It isn't until your in bed, almost asleep, that you realise you never did find out who sent you that letter. - END

- right door:
- If you chose the right door, you open it and find a bright room with a giant web. You walk inside and see a spider crawling on the ceiling. It looks at you and says "Hello!". You scream and say "What the hell? You can talk?". The spider nods and says "Yes, I can. And I'm very lonely. Do you want to be my friend?". You decide to try to escape the spider's web by making up some excuses.
- Too late!  Your stuck, seeing your struggle, the spider smiles showing wicked teeth.
It begins to rapidly make its way towards you.
Unable to reach your weapons, you nod to yourself, you close your eyes as you realise you'll never know who sent the letter now - END
