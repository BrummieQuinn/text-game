        <p>You have been summoned to a haunted mansion by a mysterious letter.
            <br> 
            You wonder who could have sent it and what they want from you. 
            <br>
            You decide to go anyway</p>

        <p>Who are you? 
    <br>
    <br>
        A. Rogue or B. Necromancer?
    <br>
    <br>
        If you choose Rogue, you can sneak around and use daggers and traps, 
    <br>
        but you have to rely on your skills and luck. You hope to find some  
    <br>
        treasure in the mansion, or at least some clues about the letter.</p>

        <p>If you choose Necromancer, you can summon undead minions to fight
    <br> 
            for you, but you have to deal with the smell and the moral implications.
    <br>    
            You hope to find some secrets in the mansion, or at least some new allies.</p>
